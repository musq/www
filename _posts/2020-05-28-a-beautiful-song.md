|              Lyrics                   |         Translation       |
|:--------------------------------------|:--------------------------|
| Jaane kyun log pyar karte hain        | I wonder why people fall in love |
| Jaane kyun woh kisi pe marte hain     | I wonder why they die for someone |
| Jaane kyun log pyar karte hain        | I wonder why people fall in love |
| Jaane kyun woh kisi pe marte hain     | I wonder why they die for someone |
| Jaane kyun ... jaane kyun             | I wonder why ... I wonder why |
| Jaane kyun, jaane kyun, jaane kyun    | I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why |

| Pyar mein, sochiye toh bas gham hai   | If you think, there is only pain in love |
| Pyar mein, joh sitam bhi ho kam hai   | In love the problems are never enough |
| Pyar mein, sar jhukana padta hai      | In love you have to bow your head |
| Dard mein, muskurana padta hai        | You have to laugh when in pain |
| Zehar kyun zindagi mein bharte hain   | Why do people add poison in their life |
| Jaane kyun log pyar karte hain        | I wonder why people fall in love |
| Jaane kyun ... jaane kyun             | I wonder why ... I wonder why |
| Jaane kyun, jaane kyun, jaane kyun    | I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why |

| Pyar bin jeene mein rakha kya hai     | What's there to live without love |
| Pyar jisko nahin woh tanha hai        | The one who doesn't have love is lonely |
| Pyar bin jeene mein rakha kya hai     | What's there to live without love |
| Pyar jisko nahin woh tanha hai        | The one who doesn't have love is lonely |
| Pyar sau rang leke aata hai           | Love brings with it a hundred colours |
| Pyar hi zindagi sajaata hai           | Love is the one that decorates life |
| Log chup chup ke pyar karte hain      | People fall in love secretly |
| Jaane kyun saaf kehte darte hai       | I wonder why they are scared to admit it |
| Jaane kyun ... jaane kyun             | I wonder why ... I wonder why |
| Jaane kyun, jaane kyun, jaane kyun    | I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why |

| Pyar bekaar ki museebat hai           | Love is a useless trouble |
| Pyar har tarah khoobsurat hai         | Love is beautiful in every way |
| Ho pyar se hum door hi achche         | I'm better off staying away from love |
| Arre pyar ke sab roop hai sacche      | All the forms of love are true |
| Ho pyar ke ghaat joh utarte hai       | Those who go down the steps of love |
| Doobte hai na woh ubharte hai         | They neither drown nor float |
| Jaane kyun ... jaane kyun             | I wonder why ... I wonder why |
| Pyar toh khair sabhi karte hain       | But still everyone falls in love |
| Jaane kyun aap hi mukarte hain        | I wonder why only you deny it |
| Jaane kyun ... jaane kyun             | I wonder why ... I wonder why |
| Jaane kyun, jaane kyun, jaane kyun    | I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why |
