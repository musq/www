"Have you ever been in love?" asked Jim. Rose didn't know!

What would I do with all these clothes? Who do I have to impress? And
why? Why should I care what a 3rd person thinks of me? Does it mean I
have to care what "chaar log kya kahenge"?

"Why do you earn money?" asked Ravi.

He was dumbfounded. He didn't know. He asked himself, but didn't get an
answer.

The answer came to him in a soft voice from a corner, and by the time it
could take a second, his life was already changed.

"To spend it".
