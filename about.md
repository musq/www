Hi, I'm Ashish. I love computers and the endless possibilities they
offer. Programming is to build beautiful products and contributing
to the [vision of Mr. Richard Stallman](https://youtu.be/L4qNuoSwmPo).

Stories about people who challenged the system for upliftment of the
society using software, fascinate me.

**I believe in privacy as a fundamental right.**

people :)
